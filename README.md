# html_minimal_example
Basic code and structure for a simple html document.
## Quick start:
- Download the repository and view 'index.html' with a web browser.
- Edit the .html files (any text editor), refresh the browser and see the updates.
- Start making your own document...
## Details:
- It's much easier to edit the .html (.css or .js) with a dedicated source code editor (for example https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
- It's good practice to run the .html (and .css) through a validator before committing an update (for example https://validator.w3.org/ and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). This code is currently up to date for HTML5.
- MDN Web Docs is a good reference for best practice on .html, .css and .js with useful guides: https://developer.mozilla.org/
- The style.css and script.js are placeholders for more advanced features not implemented (global style control and dynamic updates).
